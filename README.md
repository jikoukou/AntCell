# AntCell
A NAS algorithm created  during my integrated master thesis

## Basics 

This swarm intelligence algorithm is based on the behavior of ants in nature and creates neural network models for a given dataset. This method was tested in three popular image datasets, to produce neural networks for classification:

1) MNIST
2) Fashion-MNIST
3) Cifar-10

## Results

As it was discovered, AntCell functions well for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST compared to other popular methods but falls behind in Cifar-10.
