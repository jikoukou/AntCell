# AntCell
A NAS algorithm created  during my integrated master thesis. You are advised to read the [report](https://www.e-ce.uth.gr/wp-content/uploads/formidable/59/Koukougiannis_dimitrios.pdf) (Greek)

## Basics 

This swarm intelligence algorithm is based on the behavior of ants in nature and automatically creates neural network models for a given dataset. This method was tested in three popular image datasets, to produce neural networks for classification:

1) MNIST
2) Fashion-MNIST
3) Cifar-10

## Results

As it was discovered, AntCell functions well for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST compared to other popular methods but falls behind in Cifar-10.

## Execute

To execute the algorithm three examples called MNIST.py, FASHION_MNIST.py and Cifar10.py for each dataset, are provided. Feel free to modify the code or test it for your personal dataset.
